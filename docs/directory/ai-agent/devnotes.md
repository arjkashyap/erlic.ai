## Concepts You Need to Understand

1. **Function Calling in LLMs** - This is the ability of language models to recognize when a function should be called and with what parameters.

2. **Intent Recognition** - Identifying what the user is trying to achieve (create user, list users, etc.).

3. **Entity Extraction** - Pulling out relevant information from user queries (usernames, group names, etc.).

4. **Prompt Engineering** - Crafting effective prompts to guide the LLM's responses.

5. **Fine-tuning vs. Few-shot Learning** - Different approaches to customize an LLM for your specific domain.

## Step-by-Step Approach

1. **Choose Your Model Strategy**:
   - Using an existing API-based model (like OpenAI, Claude, etc.)
   - Self-hosting an open-source LLM (like Llama, Mistral, etc.)

2. **Design Your Schema**:
   Create a JSON schema that represents all possible actions your bot can take:
   ```json
   {
     "action": "createUser|listUsers|addToGroup|noAction",
     "parameters": {
       "username": "string",
       "firstName": "string",
       "lastName": "string",
       "groupName": "string",
       ...
     },
     "requiresConfirmation": true|false
   }
   ```

3. **Create Training Data**:
   Build examples of user queries paired with the correct JSON outputs:
   ```
   Input: "Create a new user John Smith with email john.smith@company.com"
   Output: {"action": "createUser", "parameters": {"username": "john.smith", "firstName": "John", "lastName": "Smith", "email": "john.smith@company.com"}, "requiresConfirmation": true}
   ```

4. **Implementation Path**:
   
   **Option A: API-based model with function calling**
   - Use OpenAI, Claude, or similar APIs with function calling capabilities
   - Define your functions schema in the API call
   - The model will return structured JSON matching your schema

   **Option B: Fine-tune an open-source model**
   - Fine-tune models like Llama, Mistral, or Phi
   - Train it to output JSON in the format you need
   - This requires more work but gives you more control

5. **Build Controller Logic**:
   - Receive user input
   - Send to LLM
   - Parse returned JSON
   - Call appropriate Go functions
   - Handle confirmations
   - Return results to user

## How This is Done in Typical Chatbots

Modern chatbots typically use one of three approaches:

1. **API-Based with Function Calling**: Modern commercial LLMs have built-in function calling capabilities. You define the functions and parameters, and the model returns structured data indicating which function to call.

2. **Intent Classification + Entity Extraction**: Traditional approach where you train classifiers to identify the intent and then extract relevant entities (parameters).

3. **End-to-End LLM Generation**: The LLM directly generates SQL, API calls, or code to execute, though this typically requires guardrails.

## Things to Keep in Mind

1. **Security Considerations**:
   - Ensure proper authentication for all AD operations
   - Validate all parameters before execution
   - Limit permissions of the service account
   - Log all operations for audit purposes

2. **User Experience**:
   - Always confirm destructive operations
   - Handle ambiguity gracefully ("Did you mean X or Y?")
   - Provide clear feedback on success/failure

3. **Error Handling**:
   - LLMs can hallucinate or misunderstand
   - Add validation layers between the LLM output and your AD operations
   - Have fallback strategies for when the model doesn't understand

4. **Cost and Latency**:
   - API-based models incur ongoing costs
   - Self-hosted models have higher upfront infrastructure costs
   - Consider response time expectations

## Training an LLM for This Use Case

If you decide to fine-tune an open-source model:

1. **Prepare Training Data**:
   - Create 50-200 examples of user queries and expected JSON responses
   - Include variations of how people might ask for the same thing
   - Cover edge cases and ambiguous queries

2. **Fine-Tuning Process**:
   - Choose a base model (Llama-3, Mistral, etc.)
   - Use techniques like LoRA or QLoRA for efficient fine-tuning
   - Train on your dataset using libraries like Hugging Face's transformers

3. **Evaluation**:
   - Test with queries not in your training data
   - Measure accuracy of action classification
   - Check correctness of extracted parameters
   - Assess handling of out-of-domain queries

## Recommended Approach for Your Scale

Since you mentioned this is a side project, I'd recommend starting with:

1. Use an existing API-based model with function calling (OpenAI, Claude, etc.)
2. Define your schema for all AD operations
3. Build the controller logic that connects user input to your existing Go functions
4. Add validation and confirmation steps
5. Test thoroughly with diverse queries

This approach gives you the fastest path to a working prototype without the complexity of fine-tuning your own model.

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific part of this approach, or perhaps show some sample code for the controller logic?
